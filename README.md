# Project Overview
## Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing
### Topics of interest
1. Low level of differentiation between products available
2. Customer service being ensured
3. Keeping customers for the long term 
4. Building brand loyalty

### Work plan 
1. Define what price sensitivity is and calculate it
2. Prepare the data and engineer features 
3. Test the hypothesis using a binary classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines to name a few)
4. Choose a model from one of the tested algorithms based on the model complexity, the explainability, and the accuracy of the models.
5. Extrapolate the extent to which price sensitivity influences churn

# Project Objective
