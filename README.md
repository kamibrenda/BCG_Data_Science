# Project Overview
## Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing
### Topics of interest
1. Low level of differentiation between products available
2. Customer service being ensured
3. Keeping customers for the long term 
4. Building brand loyalty

### Work plan 
1. Define what price sensitivity is and calculate it
2. Prepare the data and engineer features 
3. Test the hypothesis using a binary classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines to name a few)
4. Choose a model from one of the tested algorithms based on the model complexity, the explainability, and the accuracy of the models.
5. Extrapolate the extent to which price sensitivity influences churn

# Project Objective
Investigate the drivers for customer churning taking place at Powerco whereby the clients are switching to different providers.
# Analysis done

## Project Overview
1. Business understanding & problem framing: what is the context of the problem and whats the reason for trying to solve it?
2. Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
3. Feature engineering: can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
4. Modeling and evaluation: can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
5. Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?
